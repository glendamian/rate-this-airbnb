    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be looking at a dataset that we have cleaned ourselves about Airbnb listings. The Airbnb listings will be strictly in the Boston area for the sake of keeping the project at a reasonable scale. We will be predicting a binary value of whether a user should stay at a 'Best' listing or just a 'Decent' listing. This prediction will be made using the feature variables of text reviews and the ratings given by users out of a score of 5. The machine learning algorithms we will be using in this project are Logistic Regression Multinomial, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree."

    "<h4>Problem Statement</h4>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The topic of our project is Airbnb listings located throughout the Boston area. We are looking at listings in the Boston area for the sake of keeping this project in a doable scale. The problem we would like to tackle in this topic is to find a better metric for determining the best Airbnb listings a user should stay at. We as a group want to learn the average ratings users give these listings and if there is any relationship as to why these listings are more highly rated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Significance of the Problem</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "  A simple 5 star rating is too vague of a factor to determine whether an Airbnb is the best place for a user to stay at. Furthermore, going through all written reviews isn’t feasible. Therefore, we have taken it upon us to use machine learning algorithms to go through a large pool of diverse user reviews of Airbnb listings to efficiently give users a proper \"Best\" or \"Decent\" answer as to whether they should stay at a listing. We give these two strings as options because the average scores for the listings are very high by nature so we are trying to pinpoint which listings are the best to stay at.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The insights we can gather from this project are what kind of keywords and reviews differentiate \"excellent\" Airbnb's from the \"decent\" ones, or if there is no difference in the keywords, at all. We can figure this out by analyzing our data after our machine learning algorithms are applied. We will be going through the text within the reviews given by users and use feature extraction using text to determine how accurate the 5 star ratings are. We can also possibly see if there is any specific location that has a more favored amount of listings that generate a positive score using our metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Questions</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Out of the three algorithms (Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree), which one yields the highest classification accuracy result? Which one out of the three algorithms can we use to predict whether a listing is a \"Best\" place to stay in or just a \"Decent\" place to stay in.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many \"Best\" listings are there relative to how many \"Decent\" listings. Is there a wide difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do the results change at all when run with a different instance? This can situation can possibly arise as new reviews are constantly being written every day for each listing on Airbnb. Or is it the case that these new entries do not skew the results of our algorithms?"

    "In the reviews.csv there are 126679 rows suggesting that there are 126679 total reviews they have accumulated for Boston. This also includes an ID for the Airbnb, such that we can match the two datasets on one Airbnb.\n",

    "We decided to pick 1200 random Airbnb's from the listings.csv, and select one comment from the 126679 for each such that in our final dataframe, there are 1200 individual Airbnbs with one comment matched by their unique ID."

    "The predictive model we are creating for this project will be a multiple regression model as we will be using supervised learning in this project. The outcome variable we will be going to predict is a binary value of whether a user should stay at an Airbnb listing or not. The feature variable that will be used to predict this outcome variable are the text reviews the user submits, the user rating score given out of 5, and the id of the listing.\n",

    "* Logistic Regression: A classification algorithm that is sed to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. The dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 (yes) or 0 (no). This right here is the main reason why we want to be using this regression model as it very closely resembles the dependent variable we are trying to output.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Multinomial Naive Bayes: This is a probabilistic learning method that is mostly used in Natural Language Processing. This algorithm is based off the Bayes theorem and predicts the tag of a text - in our case the user reviews.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Decision Tree Classifier: This algorithm hierarchically splits data down into subsets which are then split again into smaller subsets until all of thea features that have been split all belong to the same class. We want to try using this algorithm as it comes with the advantage of possibly improving our accuracy by setting the logic for the branches split."

    "## 4. DISCUSSION\n",
    "\n",
    "We compared the results of Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Decision Tree Classifier to determine\n",
    "which algorithm(s) will be the best to tackle this problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   We used GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning to determine the best parameters and to check whether our model is overfitted or not. Best on the result of the GridSearch, while we are trying to determine which is the best estimator for our model. The results of our algorithms change with each instance that we run it, but we found that on average, the algorithm that has the highest cross validation score and validation set score is the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The best parameter to use for this algorithm is 'alpha=0.1'. The cross-validation score and the prediction accuracy on the training data are not 100 but not super low which suggest neither over or underfitting significantly. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Based off of these results, the algorithm that we used for our predictive model is Multinomial Naive Bayes. Based on our findings, it is safe to say that we are able to use the features in our dataset to predict the outcome variable we identified using the algorithms we applied. There is one issue that may arise for ethical implications on this project. The issue is that we use the median of the average ratings in our data to make it easier to use for us because the majority of the reviews are all heavily skewed toward a perfect 5 star rating. Other dataset bias can come from how there aren't many reviews for some listings while other listings have a great amount of reviews. For the sake of our project we manipulated our dataset to only have one review for each unique listing so this may cause a fair amount of bias in our dataset. This is because one review for a specific listing can be an outlier in the listing's general reception amongst other reviews by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any future work we can possibly use a less biased dataset as we did for the sake of this project to possibly glean any further insights. We can also apply our work on this project to other regions and see what kind of data is yielded there. This may show us that different algorithms are more favorable to use compared to the ones that we declared to be the best in our project. Also, other algorithms besides the three that we used can be applied to see any different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answers to our questions from Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "   Upon our implementation of our algorithms we can answer the questions we have asked ourselves in Part 1 of this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Out of the three algorithms (Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree), which one yields the highest classification accuracy result? Which one out of the three algorithms can we use to predict whether a listing is a \"Best\" place to stay in or just a \"Decent\" place to stay in?\n",
    "\n",
    "      Multinomial Naive Bayes was the machine learning algorithm that yielded the highest classification accuracy result. Multinomial Naive Bayes is also the algorithm that we can use to predict our binary target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many \"Best\" listings are there relative to how many \"Decent\" listings. Is there a wide difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "   The amount of \"Best\" listings is actually not too far from the amount of \"Decent\" listings because of the high saturation of very highly rated reviews in the dataset. If we wanted to pinpoint it further we would have to be stricter with what exact score we determine to be a \"Best\" listing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do the results change at all when run with a different instance? This can situation can possibly arise as new reviews are constantly being written every day for each listing on Airbnb. Or is it the case that these new entries do not skew the results of our algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "   The results do change slightly when run with different instances but it does not create a very large disparity amongst one another. Overall, the majority of the instances show that Multinomial Naive Bayes is still the best machine learning algorithm to use for this project."
